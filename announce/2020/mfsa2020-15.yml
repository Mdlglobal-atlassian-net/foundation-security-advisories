  CVE-2020-6830:
    title: Native-to-JS bridging security token exploit
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Vinoth Kumar
    description: |
      For native-to-JS bridging, the app requires a unique token to be passed that ensures non-app code can't call the bridging functions. That token was being used for JS-to-native also, but it isn't needed in this case, and its usage was also leaking this token.

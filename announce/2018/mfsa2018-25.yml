    title: Same-origin policy violation using meta refresh and performance.getEntries to steal cross-origin URLs
    impact: high
    reporter: James Lee (@Windowsrcer) of Kryptos Logic
    description: |
      A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using a <code>&lt;meta&gt; meta http-equiv="refresh"</code> on a page to cause a redirection to another site using <code>performance.getEntries()</code>. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.

  CVE-2018-12379:
    title: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Holger Fuhrmannek
    description: |
      When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

  CVE-2017-16541:
    title: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Filippo Cavallarin
    description: |
      Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a <code>file:</code> URI, bypassing configured proxy settings. <br>*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

  CVE-2018-12385:
    title: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Philipp
    description: |
      A potentially exploitable crash in <code>TransportSecurityInfo</code> used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

  CVE-2018-12383:
    title: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords
    impact: low
    reporter: Jurgen Gaeremyn
    description: |
      If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

  CVE-2018-12376:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62, Firefox ESR 60.2, and Thunderbird 60.2.1
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

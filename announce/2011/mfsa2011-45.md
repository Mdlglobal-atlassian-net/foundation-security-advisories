title: Inferring keystrokes from motion data
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>University of California, Davis researchers <strong>Liang Cai</strong>
and <strong>Hao Chen</strong> presented a paper at the 2011 USENIX HotSec
workshop on inferring keystrokes from device motion data on mobile devices.
Web pages can now receive data similar to the apps studied in that paper
and likely present a similar risk. We have decided to limit motion data
events to the currently-active tab to prevent the possibility of background
tabs attempting to decipher keystrokes the user is entering into the
foreground tab.

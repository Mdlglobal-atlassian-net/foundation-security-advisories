    reporter: Michał Bentkowski

    title: Python files could be inadvertently executed upon opening a download
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Prithwish Kumar Pal

      When Python was installed on Windows, a python file being served with the MIME type of <code>text/plain</code> could be executed by Python instead of being opened as a text file when the Open option was selected upon download. <br>*Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2019-17020:
    title: Content Security Policy not applied to XSL stylesheets applied to XML documents
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Matthew Somerville
    description: |
      If an XML file is served with a Content Security Policy and the XML file includes an XSL stylesheet, the Content Security Policy will not be applied to the contents of the XSL stylesheet. If the XSL sheet e.g. includes JavaScript, it would bypass any of the restrictions of the Content Security Policy applied to the XML document.

  CVE-2019-17021:
    title: Heap address disclosure in parent process during content process initialization on Windows
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Thomas Imbert
    description: |
      During the initialization of a new content process, a race condition occurs that can allow a content process to disclose heap addresses from the parent process. <br>*Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2019-17022:
    title: CSS sanitization does not escape HTML tags
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Michał Bentkowski
    description: |
      When pasting a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer does not escape &lt; and &gt; characters. Because the resulting string is pasted directly into the text node of the element this does not result in a direct injection into the webpage; however, if a webpage subsequently copies the node's innerHTML, assigning it to another innerHTML, this would result in an XSS vulnerability. Two WYSIWYG editors were identified with this behavior, more may exist.

  CVE-2019-17023:
    title: NSS may negotiate TLS 1.2 or below after a TLS 1.3 HelloRetryRequest had been sent
    impact: low
    reporter: Google oss-fuzz
    description: |
      After a HelloRetryRequest has been sent, the client may negotiate a lower protocol that TLS 1.3, resulting in an invalid state transition in the TLS State Machine. If the client gets into this state, incoming Application Data records will be ignored.

    description: |
      Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Christian Holler, and Bob Clary reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 71 and Firefox ESR 68.3.

  CVE-2019-11744:
    title: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML
    impact: high
    reporter: Rakesh Mane
    description: |
      Some HTML elements, such as <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to <code>.innerHTML</code> on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

  CVE-2019-11742:
    title: Same-origin policy violation with SVG filters and canvas to steal cross-origin images
    impact: high
    reporter: Paul Stone
    description: |
      A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

  CVE-2019-11743:
    title: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Yoav Weiss
    description: |
      Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the <code>unload</code> event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

  CVE-2019-11740:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 69, Firefox ESR 68.1, Firefox ESR 60.9, Thunderbird 68.1, and Thunderbird 60.9
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Nathan Froyd reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 68, Firefox ESR 68, Firefox 60.8, Thunderbird 68, and Thunderbird 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

  CVE-2020-6806:
    title: 'BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady was missing protections against state confusion'
    impact: high
    reporter: Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
    description: |
      By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

    title: Use-after-free in cubeb during stream destruction
    impact: high
    reporter: C.M.Chang

  CVE-2020-6811:
    title: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ophir LOJKINE
    description: |
      The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

  CVE-2019-20503:
    title: Out of bounds reads in sctp_load_addresses_from_init
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
    feed: false
    description: |
      The inputs to <code>sctp_load_addresses_from_init</code> are verified by <code>sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters</code>; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

  CVE-2020-6812:
    title: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
    description: |
      The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.)  Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

  CVE-2020-6814:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

  CVE-2019-9815:
    title: Disable hyperthreading on content JavaScript threads on macOS
    impact: high
    reporter: <a href="https://mdsattacks.com/#People">Multiple independent researchers</a>
    description: |
      If hyperthreading is not disabled, a timing attack vulnerability exists, similar to previous Spectre attacks. Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes use of it on the main thread and any worker threads. <br>*Note: users need to update to macOS 10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*

  CVE-2019-11694:
    title: Uninitialized memory memory leakage in Windows sandbox
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jeremy Fetiveau of SSD Secure Disclosure
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists in the Windows sandbox where an uninitialized value in memory can be leaked to a renderer from a broker when making a call to access an otherwise unavailable file.

  CVE-2019-9800:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 67 and Firefox ESR 60.7
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Bogdan Tara, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jan Varga, Gary Kwong, Tim Guan-tin Chien, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, and Ted Campbell reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 66 and Firefox ESR 60.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

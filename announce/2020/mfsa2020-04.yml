  CVE-2019-17026:
    title: IonMonkey type confusion with StoreElementHole and FallibleStoreElement
    impact: critical
    reporter: Qihoo 360 ATA
    description: |
      Incorrect alias information in IonMonkey JIT compiler for setting array elements could lead to a type confusion. We are aware of targeted attacks in the wild abusing this flaw.

  CVE-2019-17015:
    title: Memory corruption in parent process during new content process initialization on Windows
    impact: high
    reporter: Thomas Imbert
    description: |
      During the initialization of a new content process, a pointer offset can be manipulated leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash in the parent process. <br>*Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2019-17016:
    title: Bypass of @namespace CSS sanitization during pasting
    impact: high
    reporter: Michał Bentkowski
    description: |
      When pasting a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer incorrectly rewrites a @namespace rule. This could allow for injection into certain types of websites resulting in data exfiltration.

  CVE-2019-17017:
    title: Type Confusion in XPCVariant.cpp
    impact: high
    reporter: bo13oy
    description: |
      Due to a missing case handling object types, a type confusion vulnerability could occur, resulting in a crash. We presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

  CVE-2019-17021:
    title: Heap address disclosure in parent process during content process initialization on Windows
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Thomas Imbert
    description: |
      During the initialization of a new content process, a race condition occurs that can allow a content process to disclose heap addresses from the parent process. <br>*Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2019-17022:
    title: CSS sanitization does not escape HTML tags
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Michał Bentkowski
    description: |
      When pasting a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer does not escape &lt; and &gt; characters. Because the resulting string is pasted directly into the text node of the element this does not result in a direct injection into the webpage; however, if a webpage subsequently copies the node's innerHTML, assigning it to another innerHTML, this would result in an XSS vulnerability. Two WYSIWYG editors were identified with this behavior, more may exist.

  CVE-2019-17024:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 68.4.1
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Christian Holler, and Bob Clary reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 68.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

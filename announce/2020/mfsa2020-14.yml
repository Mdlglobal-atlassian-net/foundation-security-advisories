  CVE-2020-6821:
    title: Uninitialized memory could be read when using the WebGL copyTexSubImage method
    impact: high
    reporter: Jeff Gilbert, Kenneth Russell
    description: |
      When reading from areas partially or fully outside the source resource with WebGL's <code>copyTexSubImage</code> method, the specification requires the returned values be zero. Previously, this memory was uninitialized, leading to potentially sensitive data disclosure.

  CVE-2020-6822:
    title: Out of bounds write in GMPDecodeData when processing large images
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Deian Stefan

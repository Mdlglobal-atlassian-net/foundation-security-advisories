  CVE-2020-6821:
    title: Uninitialized memory could be read when using the WebGL copyTexSubImage method
    impact: high
    reporter: Jeff Gilbert, Kenneth Russell
    description: |
      When reading from areas partially or fully outside the source resource with WebGL's <code>copyTexSubImage</code> method, the specification requires the returned values be zero. Previously, this memory was uninitialized, leading to potentially sensitive data disclosure.

  CVE-2020-6822:
    title: Out of bounds write in GMPDecodeData when processing large images
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Deian Stefan
    description: |
      On 32-bit builds, an out of bounds write could have occurred when processing an image larger than 4 GB in <code>GMPDecodeData</code>. It is possible that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

  CVE-2020-6823:
    title: Malicious Extension could obtain auth codes from OAuth login flows
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Leon Visscher
    description: |
      A malicious extension could have called <code>browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow</code>, controlling the redirect_uri, and through the Promise returned, obtain the Auth code and gain access to the user's account at the service provider.

  CVE-2020-6824:
    title: Generated passwords may be identical on the same site between separate private browsing sessions
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Matthew Noorenberghe
    description: |
      Initially, a user opens a Private Browsing Window and generates a password for a site, then closes the Private Browsing Window but leaves Firefox open. Subsequently, if the user had opened a new Private Browsing Window, revisited the same site, and generated a new password - the generated passwords would have been identical, rather than independent.

  CVE-2020-6825:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

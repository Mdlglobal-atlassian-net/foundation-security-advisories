  CVE-2019-9815:
    title: Disable hyperthreading on content JavaScript threads on macOS
    impact: high
    reporter: <a href="https://mdsattacks.com/#People">Multiple independent researchers</a>
    description: |
      If hyperthreading is not disabled, a timing attack vulnerability exists, similar to previous Spectre attacks. Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes use of it on the main thread and any worker threads. <br>*Note: users need to update to macOS 10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jeremy Fetiveau of SSD Secure Disclosure
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists in the Windows sandbox where an uninitialized value in memory can be leaked to a renderer from a broker when making a call to access an otherwise unavailable file.

  CVE-2019-11695:
    title: Custom cursor can render over user interface outside of web content
    impact: moderate
    reporter: bignis
    description: |
      A custom cursor defined by scripting on a site can position itself over the addressbar to spoof the actual cursor when it should not be allowed outside of the primary web content area. This could be used by a malicious site to trick users into clicking on permission prompts, doorhanger notifications, or other buttons inadvertently if the location is spoofed over the user interface.

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      Files with the <code>.JNLP</code> extension used for "Java web start" applications are not treated as executable content for download prompts even though they can be executed if Java is installed on the local system. This could allow users to mistakenly launch an executable binary locally.

  CVE-2019-11697:
    title: Pressing key combinations can bypass installation prompt delays and install extensions
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      If the <code>ALT</code> and "a" keys are pressed when users receive an extension installation prompt, the extension will be installed without the install prompt delay that keeps the prompt visible in order for users to accept or decline the installation. A malicious web page could use this with spoofing on the page to trick users into installing a malicious extension.

  CVE-2019-11698:
    title: Theft of user history data through drag and drop of hyperlinks to and from bookmarks
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      If a crafted hyperlink is dragged and dropped to the bookmark bar or sidebar and the resulting bookmark is subsequently dragged and dropped into the web content area, an arbitrary query of a user's browser history can be run and transmitted to the content page via <code>drop</code> event data. This allows for the theft of browser history by a malicious site.

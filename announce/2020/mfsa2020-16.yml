    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 76 and Firefox ESR 68.8
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community

      Mozilla developers and community members Alexandru Michis, Jason Kratzer, philipp, Ted Campbell, Bas Schouten, Andr√© Bargull, and Karl Tomlinson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

  CVE-2018-12391:
    title: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin
    impact: high
    reporter: Jun Kokatsu
    description: |
      During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access. <br>*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

  CVE-2018-12393:
    title: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript
    impact: high
    reporter: r
    description: |
      A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write. <br>*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

  CVE-2018-12395:
    title: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
    description: |
      By rewriting the <code>Host</code> request headers using the <code>webRequest</code> API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

    title: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts
    impact: moderate

  CVE-2018-12397:
    title: 
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Rob Wu
    description: |
      A WebExtension can request access to local files without the warning prompt stating that the extension will "Access your data for all websites" being displayed to the user. This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings when a local file is opened.

  CVE-2018-12389:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3
    impact: low
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Daniel Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

  CVE-2019-9790:
    title: Use-after-free when removing in-use DOM elements
    impact: critical
    reporter: Brandon Wieser
    description: |
      A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a raw pointer to a DOM element on a page is obtained using JavaScript and the element is then removed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2019-9791:
    title: Type inference is incorrect for constructors entered through on-stack replacement with IonMonkey
    impact: critical
    reporter: Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
    description: |
      The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash.

  CVE-2019-9792:
    title: IonMonkey leaks JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT magic value to script
    impact: critical
    reporter: Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
    description: |
      The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal <code>JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT</code> magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2019-9793:
    title: Improper bounds checks when Spectre mitigations are disabled
    impact: high
    reporter: "Bruno Keith & Niklas Baumstark from the phoenhex team"
    description: |
      A mechanism was discovered that removes some bounds checking for string, array, or typed array accesses if Spectre mitigations have been disabled. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript, for which the range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect range in circumstances where users have explicitly disabled Spectre mitigations. <br> *Note: Spectre mitigations are currently enabled for all users by default settings.*

  CVE-2019-9794:
    title: Command line arguments not discarded during execution
    impact: high
    reporter: Joshua Graham
    description: |
      A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are not properly discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be used to retrieve and execute files whose location is supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme in third party applications and these applications insufficiently sanitize URL data. <br> *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2019-9795:
    title: Type-confusion in IonMonkey JIT compiler
    impact: high
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      A vulnerability where type-confusion in the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler could potentially be used by malicious JavaScript to trigger a potentially exploitable crash. 
    bugs:
      - url: 1514682
  CVE-2019-9796:
    title: Use-after-free with SMIL animation controller
    impact: high
    reporter: Nils
    description: |
      A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array.
    bugs:
      - url: 1531277
  CVE-2019-9797:
    title: Cross-origin theft of images with createImageBitmap
    impact: high
    reporter: AaylaSecura1138
    description: |
      Cross-origin images can be read in violation of the same-origin policy by exporting an image after using <code>createImageBitmap</code> to read the image and then rendering the resulting bitmap image within a <code>canvas</code> element.

      - url: 1528909
  CVE-2019-9798:
    title: Library is loaded from world writable APITRACE_LIB location
    impact: high
    reporter: Jeff Gilbert
    description: |
      On Android systems, Firefox can load a library from <code>APITRACE_LIB</code>, which is writable by all users and applications. This could allow malicious third party applications to execute a man-in-the-middle attack if a malicious code was written to that location and loaded. <br> *Note: This issue only affects Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
    bugs:
      - url: 1527534
  CVE-2019-9799:
    title: Information disclosure via IPC channel messages 
    impact: high
    reporter: Paul Theriault
    description: |
      Insufficient bounds checking of data during inter-process communication might allow a compromised content process to be able to read memory from the parent process under certain conditions.
    bugs:
      - url: 1505678
  CVE-2019-9801:
    title: "Windows programs that are not 'URL Handlers' are exposed to web content"
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Daniel Veditz
    description: |
      Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a "URL Handler" in the Windows registry. <br> *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

      - url: 1527717
  CVE-2019-9802:
    title: Chrome process information leak
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Stephen Fewer
    description: |
      If a Sandbox content process is compromised, it can initiate an FTP download which will then use a child process to render the downloaded data. The downloaded data can then be passed to the Chrome process with an arbitrary file length supplied by an attacker, bypassing sandbox protections and allow for a potential memory read of adjacent data from the privileged Chrome process, which may include sensitive data.

      - url: 1415508
  CVE-2019-9803:
    title: Upgrade-Insecure-Requests incorrectly enforced for same-origin navigation
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Xiaoyin Liu, Vinothkumar Nagasayanan
    description: |
      The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states that if UIR is enabled through Content Security Policy (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded to HTTPS. Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP URL rather than perform the security upgrade requested by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks on the linked resources.

  CVE-2019-9804:
    title: "Code execution through 'Copy as cURL' in Firefox Developer Tools on macOS"
    impact: moderate
    reporter: potatoe
    description: |
      In Firefox Developer Tools it is possible that pasting the result of the 'Copy as cURL'  command into a command shell on macOS will cause the execution of unintended additional bash script commands if the URL was maliciously crafted. This is the result of an issue with the native version of Bash on macOS. <br> *Note: This issue only affects macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2019-9807:
    title: Text sent through FTP connection can be incorporated into alert messages
    impact: low
    reporter: Hanno Böck
    description: |
      When arbitrary text is sent over an FTP connection and a page reload is initiated, it is possible to create a modal alert message with this text as the content. This could potentially be used for social engineering attacks.
    bugs:
      - url: 1362050
  CVE-2019-9809:
    title: Denial of service through FTP modal alert error messages
    impact: low
    reporter: schattendeatroth, Hanno Böck
    description: |
      If the source for resources on a page is through an FTP connection, it is possible to trigger a series of modal alert messages for these resources through invalid credentials or locations. These messages cannot be immediately dismissed, allowing for a denial of service (DOS) attack.

  CVE-2019-9808:
    title: "WebRTC permissions can display incorrect origin with data: and blob: URLs"
    impact: low
    reporter: Jun Kokatsu
    description: |
      If WebRTC permission is requested from documents with data: or blob: URLs, the permission notifications do not properly display the originating domain. The notification states "Unknown origin" as the requestee, leading to user confusion about which site is asking for this permission.

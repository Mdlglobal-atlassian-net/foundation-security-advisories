    title: Sandbox escape via installation of malicious language pack
    impact: high

  CVE-2019-11711:
    title: Script injection within domain through inner window reuse
    impact: high
    reporter: Boris Zbarsky
    description: |
      When an inner window is reused, it does not consider the use of <code>document.domain</code> for cross-origin protections. If pages on different subdomains ever cooperatively use <code>document.domain</code>, then either page can abuse this to inject script into arbitrary pages on the other subdomain, even those that did not use <code>document.domain</code> to relax their origin security.

  CVE-2019-11712:
    title: Cross-origin POST requests can be made with NPAPI plugins by following 308 redirects
    impact: high
    reporter: Gregory Smiley of Security Compass
    description: |
      POST requests made by NPAPI plugins, such as Flash, that receive a status 308 redirect response can bypass CORS requirements. This can allow an attacker to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

    title: Use-after-free with HTTP/2 cached stream
    impact: high
    reporter: Hanno Böck
    description: |

  CVE-2019-11729:
    title: Empty or malformed p256-ECDH public keys may trigger a segmentation fault
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jonas Allmann
    description: |
      Empty or malformed p256-ECDH public keys may trigger a segmentation fault due values being improperly sanitized before being copied into memory and used.

  CVE-2019-11715:
    title: HTML parsing error can contribute to content XSS
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Linus Särud
    description: |
      Due to an error while parsing page content, it is possible for properly sanitized user input to be misinterpreted and lead to XSS hazards on web sites in certain circumstances.

  CVE-2019-11717:
    title: Caret character improperly escaped in origins
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Tyson Smith
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists where the caret ("^") character is improperly escaped constructing some URIs due to it being used as a separator, allowing for possible spoofing of origin attributes.

  CVE-2019-11719:
    title: Out-of-bounds read when importing curve25519 private key
    impact: moderate 
    reporter: Henry Corrigan-Gibbs
    description: |
      When importing a curve25519 private key in PKCS#8format with leading 0x00 bytes, it is possible to trigger an out-of-bounds read in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. This could lead to information disclosure.

  CVE-2019-11730:
    title: Same-origin policy treats all files in a directory as having the same-origin
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Luigi Gubello
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use <code>file:</code> URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. Luigi Gubello demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents.

  CVE-2019-11709:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 68 and Firefox ESR 60.8
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Andreea Pavel, Christian Holler, Honza Bambas, Jason Kratzer, and Jeff Gilbert reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 67 and Firefox ESR 60.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

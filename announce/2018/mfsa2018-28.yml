  CVE-2018-12391:
    title: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin
    impact: high
    reporter: Jun Kokatsu
    description: |
      During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access. <br>*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

  CVE-2018-12393:
    title: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript
    impact: high
    reporter: R at Zero Day LLC
    description: |
      A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write. <br>*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3 and Thunderbird 60.3
    impact: low
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Daniel Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

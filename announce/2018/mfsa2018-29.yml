    title: Buffer overflow in accelerated 2D canvas with Skia
    impact: high
    reporter: Atte Kettunen

  CVE-2018-18494:
    title: Same-origin policy violation using location attribute and performance.getEntries to steal cross-origin URLs
    impact: high
    reporter: James Lee of Kryptos Logic
    description: |
      A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using the Javascript <code>location</code> property to cause a redirection to another site using <code>performance.getEntries()</code>. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.

  CVE-2018-18495:
    title: "WebExtension content scripts can be loaded in about: pages"
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Kestrel
    description: |
      WebExtension content scripts can be loaded into <code>about:</code> pages in some circumstances, in violation of the permissions granted to extensions. This could allow an extension to interfere with the loading and usage of these pages and use capabilities that were intended to be restricted from extensions.

  CVE-2018-18496:
    title: Embedded feed preview page can be abused for clickjacking
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      When the RSS Feed preview <code>about:feeds</code> page is framed within another page, it can be used in concert with scripted content for a clickjacking attack that confuses users into downloading and executing an executable file from a temporary directory. <br>*Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not affected.*

  CVE-2018-18497:
    title: WebExtensions can load arbitrary URLs through pipe separators
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Rob Wu
    description: |
      Limitations on the URIs allowed to WebExtensions by the <code>browser.windows.create</code> API can be bypassed when a pipe in the URL field is used within the extension to load multiple pages as a single argument. This could allow a malicious WebExtension to opened privileged <code>about:</code> or <code>file:</code> locations.

  CVE-2018-18498:
    title: Integer overflow when calculating buffer sizes for images
    impact: low
    reporter: r
    description: |
      A potential vulnerability leading to an integer overflow can occur during buffer size calculations for images when a raw value is used instead of the checked value. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write.

  CVE-2018-12406:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 64
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Andr√© Bargull, Boris Zbarsky, Christian Holler, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Philipp, Ronald Crane, Natalia Csoregi, and Paul Theriault reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 63. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

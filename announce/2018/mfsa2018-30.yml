  CVE-2018-12405:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 64 and Firefox ESR 60.4
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Diego Calleja, Andrew McCreight, Jon Coppeard, Jed Davis, Natalia Csoregi, Nicolas B. Pierron, and Tyson Smith reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 63 and Firefox ESR 60.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

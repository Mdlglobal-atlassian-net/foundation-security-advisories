    title: 'BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady was missing protections against state confusion'
    impact: high
    reporter: Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
    description: |
      By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2020-6808:
    title: 'URL Spoofing via javascript: URL'
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      When a JavaScript URL (javascript:) is evaluated and the result is a string, this string is parsed to create an HTML document, which is then presented. Previously, this document's URL (as reported by the document.location property, for example) was the originating javascript: URL which could lead to spoofing attacks; it is now correctly the URL of the originating document.

    title: Web Extensions with the all-urls permission could access local files
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jan Biniok

  CVE-2020-6810:
    title: Focusing a popup while in fullscreen could have obscured the fullscreen notification
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Avi Drissman of the Chrome security team
    description: |
      After a website had entered fullscreen mode, it could have used a previously opened popup to obscure the notification that indicates the browser is in fullscreen mode. Combined with spoofing the browser chrome, this could have led to confusing the user about the current origin of the page and credential theft or other attacks.

  CVE-2020-6811:
    title: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ophir LOJKINE
    description: |
      The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

  CVE-2019-20503:
    title: Out of bounds reads in sctp_load_addresses_from_init
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
    feed: false
    description: |
      The inputs to <code>sctp_load_addresses_from_init</code> are verified by <code>sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters</code>; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

  CVE-2020-6812:
    title: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
    description: |
      The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.)  Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

    title: '@import statements in CSS could bypass the Content Security Policy nonce feature'
    impact: low
    reporter: Matheus Vrech
    description: |
      When protecting CSS blocks with the nonce feature of Content Security Policy, the @import statement in the CSS block could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary styles, bypassing the intent of the Content Security Policy.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

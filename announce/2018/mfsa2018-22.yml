    title: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Philipp
    description: |
      A potentially exploitable crash in <code>TransportSecurityInfo</code> used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacher to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

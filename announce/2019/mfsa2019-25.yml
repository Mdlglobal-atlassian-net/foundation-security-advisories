  CVE-2019-11751:
    title: Malicious code execution through command line parameters
    impact: critical
    reporter: Ping Fan (Zetta) Ke of VXRL working with iDefense Labs
    description: |
      Logging-related command line parameters are not properly sanitized when Firefox is launched by another program, such as when a user clicks on malicious links in a chat application. This can be used to write a log file to an arbitrary location such as the Windows 'Startup' folder. <br>*Note: this issue only affects Firefox on Windows operating systems.*

  CVE-2019-11744:
    title: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML
    impact: high
    reporter: Rakesh Mane
    description: |
      Some HTML elements, such as <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to <code>.innerHTML</code> on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

  CVE-2019-11742:
    title: Same-origin policy violation with SVG filters and canvas to steal cross-origin images
    impact: high
    reporter: Paul Stone
    description: |
      A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

  CVE-2019-11736:
    title: File manipulation and privilege escalation in Mozilla Maintenance Service
    impact: high
    reporter: Seb Patane
    description: |
      The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the <code>updates</code> directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access. <br>*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

  CVE-2019-11753:
    title: Privilege escalation with Mozilla Maintenance Service in custom Firefox installation location
    impact: high
    reporter: Holger Fuhrmannek
    description: |
      The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally. <br>*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

  CVE-2019-11752:
    title: Use-after-free while extracting a key value in IndexedDB
    impact: high
    reporter: Zhanjia Song
    description: |
      It is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2019-9812:
    title: Sandbox escape through Firefox Sync
    impact: high
    reporter: Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
    description: |
      Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading <code>accounts.firefox.com</code> in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered.

  CVE-2019-11741:
    title: Isolate addons.mozilla.org and accounts.firefox.com
    impact: high
    reporter: Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
    description: |
      A compromised sandboxed content process can perform a Universal Cross-site Scripting (UXSS) attack on content from any site it can cause to be loaded in the same process. Because <code>addons.mozilla.org</code> and <code>accounts.firefox.com</code> have close ties to the Firefox product, malicious manipulation of these sites within the browser can potentially be used to modify a user's Firefox configuration. These two sites will now be isolated into their own process and not allowed to be loaded in a standard content process.

  CVE-2019-11743:
    title: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Yoav Weiss
    description: |
      Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the <code>unload</code> event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

  CVE-2019-11748:
    title: Persistence of WebRTC permissions in a third party context
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
    description: |
      WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use.

  CVE-2019-11749:
    title: Camera information available without prompting using getUserMedia
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Andreas Pehrson
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the <code>getUserMedia</code> API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users.

  CVE-2019-11737:
    title: Content security policy directives ignore port and path if host is a wildcard
    impact: low
    reporter: Xiaoyin Liu
    description: |
      If a wildcard ('*') is specified for the host in Content Security Policy (CSP) directives, any port or path restriction of the directive will be ignored, leading to CSP directives not being properly applied to content.

  CVE-2019-11738:
    title: Content security policy bypass through hash-based sources in directives
    impact: low
    reporter: Wladimir Palant
    description: |
      If a Content Security Policy (CSP) directive is defined that uses a hash-based source that takes the empty string as input, execution of any <code>javascript:</code> URIs will be allowed. This could allow for malicious JavaScript content to be run, bypassing CSP permissions.

  CVE-2019-11747:
    title: "'Forget about this site' removes sites from pre-loaded HSTS list"
    impact: low
    reporter: Thomas Henlich
    description: |
      The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an <code>http:</code> URL rather than secure <code>https:</code> they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored.

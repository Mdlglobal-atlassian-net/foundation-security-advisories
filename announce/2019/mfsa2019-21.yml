    title: Sandbox escape via installation of malicious language pack
    impact: high
    reporter: Niklas Baumstark
    description: |
      As part of his winning Pwn2Own entry, Niklas Baumstark demonstrated a sandbox escape by installing a malicious language pack and then opening a browser feature that used the compromised translation.

  CVE-2019-11711:
    title: Script injection within domain through inner window reuse
    impact: high
    reporter: Boris Zbarsky
    description: |
      When an inner window is reused, it does not consider the use of <code>document.domain</code> for cross-origin protections. If pages on different subdomains ever cooperatively use <code>document.domain</code>, then either page can abuse this to inject script into arbitrary pages on the other subdomain, even those that did not use <code>document.domain</code> to relax their origin security.

  CVE-2019-11712:
    title: Cross-origin POST requests can be made with NPAPI plugins by following 308 redirects
    impact: high
    reporter: Gregory Smiley of Security Compass
    description: |
      POST requests made by NPAPI plugins, such as Flash, that receive a status 308 redirect response can bypass CORS requirements. This can allow an attacker to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

    title: NeckoChild can trigger crash when accessed off of main thread
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Hanno Böck
    description: |
      Necko can access a child on the wrong thread during UDP connections, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

  CVE-2019-11729:
    title: Empty or malformed p256-ECDH public keys may trigger a segmentation fault
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jonas Allmann
    description: |
      Empty or malformed p256-ECDH public keys may trigger a segmentation fault due values being improperly sanitized before being copied into memory and used.

  CVE-2019-11715:
    title: HTML parsing error can contribute to content XSS
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Linus Särud
    description: |
      Due to an error while parsing page content, it is possible for properly sanitized user input to be misinterpreted and lead to XSS hazards on web sites in certain circumstances.

  CVE-2019-11716:
    title: globalThis not enumerable until accessed
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Chris Hacking
    description: |
      Until explicitly accessed by script, <code>window.globalThis</code> is not enumerable and, as a result, is not visible to code such as <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window)</code>. Sites that deploy a sandboxing that depends on enumerating and freezing access to the window object may miss this, allowing their sandboxes to be bypassed.

  CVE-2019-11717:
    title: Caret character improperly escaped in origins
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Tyson Smith
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists where the caret ("^") character is improperly escaped constructing some URIs due to it being used as a separator, allowing for possible spoofing of origin attributes.

  CVE-2019-11718:
    title: Activity Stream writes unsanitized content to innerHTML
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Mark Banner
    description: |
      Activity Stream can display content from sent from the Snippet Service website. This content is written to <code>innerHTML</code> on the Activity Stream page without sanitization, allowing for a potential access to other information available to the Activity Stream, such as browsing history, if the Snipper Service were compromised.

  CVE-2019-11719:
    title: Out-of-bounds read when importing curve25519 private key
    impact: moderate 
    reporter: Henry Corrigan-Gibbs
    description: |
      When importing a curve25519 private key in PKCS#8format with leading 0x00 bytes, it is possible to trigger an out-of-bounds read in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. This could lead to information disclosure.

  CVE-2019-11720:
    title: Character encoding XSS vulnerability
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Rakesh Mane
    description: |
      Some unicode characters are incorrectly treated as whitespace during the parsing of web content instead of triggering parsing errors. This allows malicious code to then be processed, evading cross-site scripting (XSS) filtering.

      - url: 1556230
  CVE-2019-11721:
    title: "Domain spoofing through unicode latin 'kra' character"
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Anonymous
    description: |
      The unicode latin 'kra' character can be used to spoof a standard 'k' character in the addressbar. This allows for domain spoofing attacks as do not display as punycode text, allowing for user confusion.

  CVE-2019-11730:
    title: Same-origin policy treats all files in a directory as having the same-origin
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Luigi Gubello
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use <code>file:</code> URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. Luigi Gubello demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents.

  CVE-2019-11723:
    title: Cookie leakage during add-on fetching across private browsing boundaries
    impact: low
    reporter: Andreas Wagner
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists during the installation of add-ons where the initial fetch ignored the origin attributes of the browsing context. This could leak cookies in private browsing mode or across different "containers" for people who use the Firefox Multi-Account Containers Web Extension.

  CVE-2019-11724:
    title: Retired site input.mozilla.org has remote troubleshooting permissions
    impact: low
    reporter: Frederik Braun
    description: |
      Application permissions give additional remote troubleshooting permission to the site input.mozilla.org, which has been retired and now redirects to another site. This additional permission is unnecessary and is a potential vector for malicious attacks.

  CVE-2019-11725:
    title: Websocket resources bypass safebrowsing protections
    impact: low
    reporter: Andrey
    description: |
      When a user navigates to site marked as unsafe by the Safebrowsing API, warning messages are displayed and navigation is interrupted but resources from the same site loaded through websockets are not blocked, leading to the loading of unsafe resources and bypassing safebrowsing protections.

  CVE-2019-11727:
    title: PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures can be used for TLS 1.3 
    impact: low
    reporter: Hubert Kario
    description: |
      A vulnerability exists where it possible to force Network Security Services (NSS) to sign <code>CertificateVerify</code> with PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures when those are the only ones advertised by server in <code>CertificateRequest</code> in TLS 1.3. PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures should not be used for TLS 1.3 messages.

    title: Port scanning through Alt-Svc header
    impact: low
    reporter: Trishita Tiwari, Ari Trachtenberg
    description: |
      The HTTP Alternative Services header, <code>Alt-Svc</code>, can be used by a malicious site to scan all TCP ports of any host that the accessible to a user when web content is loaded.

  CVE-2019-11710:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 68
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members André Bargull, Christian Holler, Natalia Csoregi, Raul Gurzau, Daniel Varga, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous, Gary Kwong, Randell Jesup, David Bolter, Jeff Gilbert, and Deian Stefan reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 67. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
